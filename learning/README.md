# Loan Risk Prediction Project: A Learning Guide

Welcome to the Loan Risk Prediction project! This guide is designed to help you understand the structure and workflow of this project, from data processing to model deployment.

This project has been recently refactored to streamline the workflow, consolidate redundant scripts, and improve overall clarity. The documentation has been updated to reflect this new, more efficient structure.

## Project Phases

The project is now divided into five distinct phases:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** This phase focuses on cleaning, transforming, and preparing the raw data for modeling. It is handled by a single, comprehensive script.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this phase, we explore the processed data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships that can inform our modeling approach.
3.  **Model Training and Evaluation:** This phase involves training various machine learning models, tuning their hyperparameters, and evaluating their performance to select the best model.
4.  **Post-Training Visualization:** After training, we generate visualizations to analyze the final model's performance and feature importances.
5.  **Deployment:** In the final phase, we deploy the best-performing model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Navigate through the subdirectories in this `learning` folder to explore each phase in detail. Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file that explains the purpose of the scripts and files in that phase.
