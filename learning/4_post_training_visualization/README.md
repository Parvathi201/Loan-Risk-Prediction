# Phase 4: Post-Training Visualization

After training and selecting our final model, this phase focuses on generating visualizations to analyze its performance and interpret its predictions. These visualizations provide a deeper understanding of the model's behavior and help communicate its effectiveness.

## Key Files and Scripts

-   `scripts/generate_visualizations.py`: This script is dedicated to creating post-training visualizations. It loads the final model, its features, and the evaluation results to generate several key plots:
    -   **Model Performance Comparison:** Bar plots that compare the performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) of all the models that were trained.
    -   **Feature Importance:** A bar plot showing the most important features as determined by the final Random Forest model. This helps us understand which factors have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.
    -   **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap that visualizes the correlation between the numerical features in the processed dataset.
    -   **Class Distribution:** A pie chart showing the distribution of the target variable (`default`), which helps visualize the class imbalance.

-   `reports/figures/`: All the visualizations generated by this script are saved in this directory. Key plots include:
    -   `model_comparison.png`
    -   `feature_importance.png`
    -   `feature_correlation.png`
    -   `class_distribution.png`

-   `reports/model_training_results.csv`: This CSV file, generated during the model training phase, is used here to create the model comparison plots.
